          Since I was a child, always loved to disassemble electronics, format,
          and customize computers to see how it{"'"}s done by the inside, over
          time the toys begin to get bigger, and I started to work in an
          internet provider.
          <Text fontWeight={"bold"}>MKANET</Text>
          In November 2014 I started to work in MKANET Telecom, first as a
          Customer Support, then in the Network Operation Center, and finally
          the CGR, or, Network Management Center (here in Brazil, the CGR runs
          the entire network), where I learned much about how the networking
          really works, using technologies like BGP, OSPF, MPLS, PPP, IPsec, and
          others, we maintain a fiber optics/wireless ISP.
          <Text fontWeight={"bold"}>The Switch</Text>
          After 6 years as a network engineer, I received the opportunity to
          change to the development realm, that is the place I work today as a
          full-stack engineer in a company that provides technologies to banks
          and fintech, including all the backend to the new Brazilian instant
          payment method Pix.
          <Text fontWeight={"bold"}>Current Stack</Text>
          Today my main development language is JavaScript, using tools like
          NodeJS, React, PostgreSQL, Docker, Terraform, I manage to build entire
          applications, from the frontend to the deployment pipeline that runs
          inside the repository.
          <Text fontWeight={"bold"}>Daily Basis</Text>I think as a technology
          passionate, my duty is always be in the search of innovation, using
          development to create and improve products around the world.
